For a while I was the DM for Shadowrun and I liked that. Nowadays I much prefer
simple systems with big ideas coming out of the osr scene. With the release of
Cyberpunk Red & 2077 I wanted to see if I could design something that would
allow quick character generation and provide a good framework for stories where
player skills are more important than character sheets.

The thing is, while cyberpunk settings bring plenty exciting world building
ideas, I find it hard to translate them into a game for multiple reasons:

- Games have a big focus on character customization: what type of mods have you
  installed? mechanical legs? wolverine styled hidden blades? Those often
  provide only minor mechanical advantage and are mostly picked for aesthetic
  reasons.

- Same problem with "normal" equipment: there are often big lists of weapons.
  Complex weapon stats are introduced in order to distinguish different types of
  similar guns (damage, rate of fire, penetration, etc).

- Characters are often specialized agents (hacker, fighter, spy, etc). You get
  large skill lists with all the associated problems: slower character
  generation and tricky rulings. Many games introduce complex subsystems (for
  driving, hacking, drone handling). In shadowrun a hacker literally plays a
  different game all by himself while the rest of the table stares at him. This
  kills the pacing (and the GM that have to learn whole set or rules and
  equipments just for this single player).

- Sessions are very rigid. So this might very well be a lack of experience on my
  side but I have lots of troubles getting over the "steal the tech macguffin
  from this evil megacorp" template. You might argue that many people like
  robbing dungeons over and over. But I find it easier to suspend my disbelief
  with weird dungeon tricks and monsters. The design space for corps seems much
  more limited. They are not made by some unknown forgotten forces but by modern
  people with rational goals. So you can design a rich and fun political
  backdrop but the actual game is less varied.

Certainly there must be some way around those issues.
