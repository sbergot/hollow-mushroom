I still need to read more cyberpunk material to get more baggage. That said I
also want to explore various categories of rebels using the same method as in
the previous post: look at the real world and exaggerate.

What are the "rebels" of our world:

- Marginals. Hobos that survive in the corner of society. They barely survive on
  the scraps. They don't have a particular goal apart from survival. They remind
  the normal workers that something is not going right in the world. For this
  reason they face more and more oppositions from the police.

- External autonomous communities aka intentional communities. Examples include
  the East Wind Community and Nomadelfia. They are united around a set of
  values. Those are bigger, less visible are more organized. They rarely have
  any impact on the rest of the world. Corporations dislike them because of what
  they represent. Those communities can also block the access to some natural
  resources.

- Political activists. They live in the system to some extent but are fighting
  against it. They are also united around an ideology. Contrary to the external
  autonomous communities, political activist are trying to change the rest of
  the society. They may use different means of actions but they can never stay
  100% legal. Corporations hate them for their actions and what they represent.

- Chaos agents. Those people just want to see the system burn. They are using
  the word "system" as loosely as I am in these posts: anything that relates to
  the conventional social organization. Maybe they have some deeper ideology but
  it is less important now. The only thing that matters is "how do we fuck
  things up as efficiently as possible". They have become professional rioter
  and saboteur. They probably used to belong to another group and were
  radicalized because of some unsettling events or maybe just for the thrill of
  action. They often join forces with other groups on specific operations. They
  might even help a corporation against another one in some cases.

I feel we have enough with those four groups. Where should the player belong? I
am rather convinced that they should live in the last one.

- it provides more flexibility for the story.
- it leads to harder dilemmas

The only issue is getting the player to buy in this new identity. A new player
should have little doubt that he on the good side of history. After a few
sessions? not so much. In fight club the story gets away so easily with blowing
up multiple buildings without any casualties. Don't make the same mistake if
your players want to solve their problems with C4.
