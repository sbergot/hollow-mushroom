How to streamline hacking in a cyberpunk game.

<!-- more -->

In the previous post I have established a number of issues with common cyberpunk
games. Hacking has them all: a specific set of skill, equipment and rules that
must be listed and learned and are a nightmare at the table.

# How hacking fits in cyberpunk?

- It is modern punk culture. Alternative and anarchist. Talented individuals can
  confront big corporation with some custom tools and their wits.

- It outlines the consequences of modern technologies. Now suddenly your email
  account becomes a proof of identity and can be used against you. In the name
  of convenience everything becomes connected and those connections are not
  safe. People have a hard time grasping this new reality. Even corporate don't
  understand how to recognize good security because this is a very abstract
  domain. In the physical world you can look at a door and estimate how solid it
  is. Not so much with a server farm or a power plant.

- It is a versatile tool for players. Player can use it to manipulate
  information, take control of surveillance cameras, lock/unlock doors or even
  break stuff by operating them out of spec. In D&D the classic spell list has
  become more of a handy toolbox than a mysterious source of power. In cyberpunk
  hacking has gone from a mundane tool to an almost magic capability.

# The risks

Hacking has some drawbacks. It is powerful for small organizations because it is
much easier to attack than to defend. If a lone individual becomes a target he
is immediately crushed. The only protection is anonymity. When a hacker tries to
subvert a system, every trace left may be gathered to form a puzzle that will
allow the target to notice him, locate him, and ultimately identify him.

Identifying a hacker may means that you recognize some patterns in his fake
identities, or even his physical location. You can spot him easily but also send
some people to arrest him. The hacker needs to lay low somewhere or make some
drastic change if he wants to stay free (like getting rid of his equipment and
find a new place to live).

# Target states

Time to convert all this in game design goal. First a player states that he
wants to hack into something in order to achieve some goal. He will need some
equipment and if your game has a skill system, the right skill.

Then it should be an opposed race. The player is trying to achieve his goal. The
targeted system progress in the *oblivious* -> *alerted* -> *attack located* ->
*attacker identified*. Each side rolls a dice on its and progress on its track.

* Oblivious: no indication that anything is happening. If the player succeed at
  this step it is a total victory
* Alerted: something is happening but few elements are available. At this point
  the attacker risks are rising quickly. Even if he succeed at this step he has
  left some minor traces. From now on the target might decide to shutdown its
  system in some cases to protect valuable assets. Shutting down the system
  might still be a form of minor victory for the attacker.
* Attack located: the system knows what is targeted and what means are used. It
  is now able to defend itself actively. Next rolls attacker rolls should be
  more difficult. Traces left by the attacker might lead to identification later
  even if the attacker stops and retreat.
* Attacker identified: the system is able to defend even better. The attacker
  will have to face heavy consequences sooner or later.

Rolls on both side should be kept simple (D20 vs DC using a stat or a skill).
Special equipment like a custom program or chip might give a bonus or a penalty
under interesting circumstances:
* -1 to detection checks when the hacking while connected with a wire inside a
  building hosting the system
* +2 on hacking roll while target is oblivious

Rolls should be swingy. Preliminary legwork (such as stealing an employee
identity) should give bonuses. After each pair of rolls the player should have
to decide if he should push further or retreat. The system can have multiple
targets with various difficulty levels to increase the complexity of those
decisions.

As much as possible, this should be intertwined with actions from
other players.
- the other PCs are fending of guards while waiting for the door to unlock.
- a player has a fake ID and a guard has taken it for a check. Can the hacker
  register the fake ID before the guard scans the card?
