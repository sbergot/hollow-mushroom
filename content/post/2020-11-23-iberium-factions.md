This is the third part of the frozen colony series. It discusses the factions in
Iberium.

A good faction network serves multiple purpose.
- It outlines the world they live in. Who are those people? What do they do?
- It creates a crucible that allows you to generate conflicts. And conflicts
  create interesting stories.

**Note on *How to get in***: This can be used as a hook for an adventure. It
does not mean that players can become part of any organization, just that they
can earn some level of protection.

Let's see what we can put here!

Iberium is the first city the player will visit. It is a place where the old
kingdoms have some presence. However it provides an outlook into the rest of the
world. It is a mix of a late medieval port and a nomad camp.

# The authorities

The authorities are the reason why this whole thing exists. They have enough
forces to maintain some order but are still a minority.

- The company is at the same time the main administrator and the law enforcement
  of the city. Its soldiers are cold and brutal. Its administrators are even
  worse. It is making a lot of money out of this situation. Its power is slowly
  rising to a level comparable to the old kingdom. Iberium is a key place for
  the company since it is where it collects all the riches from the colony and
  send them away. The main fort serves as a storage place. The company collect a
  hefty tax on all boats docking at the port.

  **How to get in:** player can act as informant for the soldiers. They can
  reveal where the dockers have hidden a bunch of weapons, or they can clean a
  street that a priest is going to visit from its beggars.

- The kingdom of Rowia (referred by the colonist as "the Old Kingdom") sends a
  few nobles to supervise an audit the operations. Most of them hate the lack of
  comfort and being far from the political game. They try to shake things up a
  bit and come back to brag about it as soon as possible. Or they pocket some
  corruption money and move on.

  **How to get in:** the player can provide interesting information about the
  company. An hidden commercial route. A mean to communicate with a corrupted
  politician. Think of an high risk/high reward operation. If they get caught
  the chances of escaping death is slim. If they succeed they will have
  significant leverage.

- Some church representative come to make sure that the colonists keep praying
  and respecting their commandments. Those who don't are publicly burnt. This is
  always a popular event thanks to the warmth.
  
  Missionaries are coming in order to convert the tribes but those usually move
  quickly further in the mainland.

  **How to get in:** players can reveal some forbidden behaviors. Beggars have
  been stealing the corpses of exiled who died during their first night. They
  steal their clothes and use the bodies as fuel. Other people may be aware but
  don't want to draw attention on this point because even the company could
  resort to such practice if they need to. As everyone knows, the church has the
  monopoly on burning people.

  Missionaries may request the help from the player to travel.

# The guilds

Guilds represent the main workforce of the colony. They act like medieval
unions. Most members are workers but some older leaders take a more political
role.

- The docker's guild is the biggest one. Iberium is the biggest port on the
  coast and the only one where the merchant boats can dock. From the old
  kingdoms the boats bring all kind of material (food, clothes, construction
  materials) and the poor exiled. The dockers are numerous and extremely loyal.
  The company's soldiers don't really need or want to stick their neck too much
  in the area. They will come when important cargo is moved that day but won't
  stay too long.

  **How to get in**

- The sea hunter's guild is also quite big. Don't call them fishermen if you
  want good relations. Around Silberland fishes are often big enough to break a
  boat in half. You could sail out there with a net and try to grab a few
  salmons but without a big harpoon to defend yourself the risk is too high. So
  the only people crazy enough to wander around are trying to bring back big
  game. When they succeed they can make a nice profit out of it. A sea creature
  will provide meat for the hungry, oil for the torches, skin for the clothes,
  etc. With that money they will need to pay the salaries to their men or their
  widows, fix the damages on their boat, and finance the next expedition.
