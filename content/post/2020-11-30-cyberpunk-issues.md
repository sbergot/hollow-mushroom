I would like to run some cyberpunk game but I have a few issues.

<!-- more -->

For a while I was the DM for Shadowrun and I liked that. Nowadays I much prefer
simple systems with big ideas coming out of the osr scene. With the release of
Cyberpunk Red & 2077 I wanted to see if I could design something that would
allow quick character generation and provide a good framework for stories where
player skills are more important than character sheets.

The thing is, while cyberpunk settings brings plenty exciting world building
ideas, I find it hard to translate them into a game for multiple reasons:

- Games have a big focus on character customization: what type of mods have you
  installed? mechanical legs? wolverine styled hidden blades? Those often
  provide only minor mechanical advantage and are mostly picked for aesthetic
  reasons. 

- Same problem with equipment: there are often big lists of and weapons. Complex
  weapon stats are introduced in order to distinguish different types of similar
  guns (damage, rate of fire, penetration, etc).

- Characters are often specialized agents (hacker, fighter, spy, etc). You get
  large skill lists with all the associated problems: slower character
  generation and tricky rulings. Many games introducing complex subsystems (for
  driving, hacking, drone handling). In shadowrun a hacker literally plays a
  different game. This kills the pacing (and the GM that have to learn whole set
  or rules and equipments just for this single player).

- Sessions are very rigid. So this might very well be a lack of experience on my
  side but I have lots of troubles getting over the "steal macguffin from this
  evil megacorp" template. You might argue that many people like robbing
  dungeons over and over. But I find it easier to suspend my disbelief with
  weird dungeon tricks and monsters. The design space for corps seems much more
  limited because they are not made by some unknown forgotten forces but modern
  people with rational goals. So you can design a rich and fun political
  backdrop but the actual game is less varied.

Certainly there must be some way around those issues.
