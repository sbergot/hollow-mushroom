Lately I have been playing with the mausritter world building tools. Here is
something that I might use in a future oneshot.

# The setting

The basic idea is that the home settlement is located in a small village in a
radioactive area. More precisely, it is on top of an old carousel under the
tent-like structure. For an unspecified reason the structure is protecting the
mice. They call it the **arch**.

Going outside is dangerous but necessary to retrieve food and water. Small
parties called **spotters** are going around looking for loot. Once a source has
been located, a caravan is sent there using the shortest and most efficient path
possible. Those who stay outside for too long fall victim of the **curse**. They
get sicker and sicker until die in great suffering.

The leader of the settlement is the head of a cult dedicated to the horse
statues that compose the carousel. They are viewed as the **guardians** of the
settlement. Rituals are performed in their names. Anyone who deviates from the
traditions risks angering the guardian.

The non-believers are the biggest group in the settlement but keep a low profile
because they don't want to be cast out. Many mice are discussing what
protections are effective against the curse. Every mouse have its own probably
incorrect solution: eating dirt, painting one's ears in red, etc. A few old mice
have known the **blessed era** when they would mostly live outside. Humans used
to be there too and those where sometimes dangerous. Freedom was worth this
price.

Most mice believe that the curse is a global phenomenon. Parties have been sent
away but since the curse takes a few weeks to reveal its effects no one is sure
if things are safer elsewhere. Some mice called the **escapists** think that the
phenomenon is local, although they disagree how large is the affected area. If
anyone is caught publicly discussing this topic he is immediately accused of
heresy and risks being cast out of the arch ("leave now if you so dearly wish
so!").

# How to run the setting

PCs take the role of a fresh group of spotters. They need to go outside to find
food. They mostly look for fruits, grains and seeds. If an animal come in the
area they might wait for it to die and loot its corpse. This can be used to
generate a first session.

The first time the mice go outside just let them accomplish their mission. The
next time however be sure to introduce new elements. Those can be:

- an unknown mice party wear strange clothes. They look older than most spotters
  from the arch meaning that they may have found an effective protection.
- a caravan got lost. He has found some strange device emitting noise. Its noise
  seems to be linked to the intensity of the curse.
