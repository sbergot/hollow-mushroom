Like Hacking, cyberwares fit both in the theme and the mechanics of a cyberpunk
ttrpg:

- They raise questions about the perils of technology and about the sense of
  self-identity
- They allow for crazy character aesthetics
- They provide interesting customization options for PCs as well as NPCs

# Designing cyberware

Cyberware is a staple of cyberpunk. The common issues I have are the following:
- big equipment lists
- lots of stats used to model the wide variety of equipments

Cyberware should be treated like magic items in D&D: every piece is unique and
has its effect described using english language instead of additional stats.
They might be slightly more common and even allowed for a new character but if
you make them harder to get they will feel cooler for your player.

# Balancing cyberware

Usually cyberware have some drawbacks in games. In shadowrun there is a
cyberware body budget that limits the amount of equipment a character can
install. This usually acts as a hard limit: you can spend 99% of this budget
without any issue but if you go over 100% you die. I am not a fan of this kind
of hard limits and would like a smoother "counter effect" to rigging yourself
until you are devoid of any trace of flesh.

One interesting point about cyberware is that it is produced by the bad guy of
the setting ie the corporations. So players using them are fighting fire with
fire. It should not be a moral issue for most because PCs should be practical
about those things. However we may be able to plug in a mechanism previously
discussed: the Heat level.

You know how the police can study a crime scene and collect piece of information
that can reveal information about a weapon? Not just a weapon type, but the
individual model which has an entry in their database? And that this database
may reveal in turn when this equipment was built and sold? I think it is fair to
say that most piece of cyberware can be tracked in some way. There is an Id in
each piece of equipment. And NFC chips. In every street there are cameras with
thermal and electromagnetic modes.

Surely a good tech specialist should be able to get rid of this kind of
signature? For the most part yes. But not entirely. That means that any
cyberware is going to leave some additional trace. Which translate to more heat.
If you don't want to add a "heat malus" stat, you might just make it a constant
across all equipment by default. Special equipment may have "no heat malus" or
"double heat malus".

# The rule of cool

This one is tricky. I used to play some feng-shui where you get a bonus every
time someone made something cool. It got boring quickly with a lot of forced
awkward actions. However most pieces of cyberware sit in the "moderately useful,
slightly stupid, cool as hell" design space. When someone thinks of something
cool but you have a few minor objections, try to let it go and allow it.

This is a very subjective limit to place. It will depend on the tone of the game
and the player expectations.

# Cyberware samples

- bone retractable claws: 1D6 damage. Passes normal security checks. No heat
  malus.
- power legs: gives 18 strength for leg actions. Allows for higher jumps but
  only slightly reduce fall damage. Leg attacks like kicking or jumping on
  someone deals 1D8 damage. Double heat malus.
- Rocket metal head. A small reactor at the back of the head allows the PC to
  perform a powerful headbutt.
- Thermal vision.
- Face reader: gives indicators about people's faces - stress level variation,
  emotion variations, etc.
- hands propeller. The PC is able to cast his hands away. They remain attached
  to his arm with a cable. The pc is still able to operate his hands. Can be
  used for punching, climbing, or operating something remotely.
