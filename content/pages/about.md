My name is Simon Bergot and I am a software engineer currently living in the
netherlands. I am passionate about tabletop role playing games.

This blog contains short posts discussing ttrpg systems and settings. I aim for
rule-light immersive games. My biggest influences are Questing Beast (Knave) and
Chris McDowall (Into the odd).
