# Preparing a story

With Role playing games it is not enough to read some rules to start a session. The GM has to prepare a story. This might seem daunting but is also part of the fun. You will need places, characters and conflicts.

## Places

Running a successful session will require that every player share the same imaginary space. Some people use a board with a map and a grid, but other just describe the locations and maybe show some pictures. This shared space will dictate the aesthetics of the game and what kind of events are taking place. Deciding to play in an abandoned house or in a forest will have major consequences so take some time to pick a general ideas. You are looking for places that inspire you some details and events. Can you picture the kitchen in the old house? The river in the forest? Does the place starts to fill itself with interesting details? Then it is a good choice.

Now draw the major elements of the place. You don't have to show this drawing
(you certainly can if you wish!). Drawing will help you to organize the space and create relation between elements. Is the kitchen near the entrance? Where are the stairs that lead to the cellar? Don't dig too deep. You can always come back to this step if you need to.

The first place to design is the town where the mice are living. The second is a more abstract layout of the surrounding area.

    My town is located around a big oak. It is called the village of the leaf. Some big houses are build on the ground and some smaller ones are fixed on the trunk. They are connected with a networks of bridges and ladder and a small cave system inside the tree.

## Characters

Think about your settlement: how big is it? what are the mice doing during the day? How does they feed themselves? How are they organized? Answering those questions will give you a list of jobs to be filled. You don't have to make an exhaustive list of the villagers, but it is good to have between five and ten non-player characters (NPCs).

    The village of the leaf has a mayor who is also a carpenter named Jack. He was the one who was able to design those cool houses on the trunk. Bob lives at the bottom of the tree and is a miner and a banker. Melinda is an old lady living in the highest house. She knows about rare plants and how to make medicines out of them. She also knows the forest and anything that lives in it very well. An owl is also living in the tree near melinda's house. Do they know each other?

Some characters will be your information providers. In the example bellow Jack will know everything about the village and its inhabitant. Any major problem will be quickly reported to him. Melinda will be able to explain things about the rat tribe found north of the village.

Try to link the place and the NPCs as tightly as possible. Don't hesitate to adjust the layout if you need to.

## Pulling the players inside

At this point it is a good idea to think about how the players will be tied to the story. This can be done at the beginning of the first session. It can even be a standalone affair. Ask your player questions. What is their role? Are they scavenging for food? Are they crafting goods? Where do they live? Where they born here? If not how did they arrive in this village? Why are they still here? What is their relations with this or that villager?

This will be your first interactions with the player and you will discover how they dive in the world. If they struggle to come up with answers try to be more specific: "Jack is someone from your family. You live in the same house. How are you going along?". You can also provide a choice between multiple choices:
"maybe you can be a ranger that warn the village if a beast is approaching? Or you can be a mice that sew clothes?"

You want your player to get a feel of the village, how it is organized and how they fit. You want to build links with other villagers. If a player has an idea for the village then good for you! The more involved they are the better.

## Conflicts

Now that we have some context, we need something to happen in it. The conflict should be the engine responsible for moving the story forward. If no one act the situation is likely to get worse and something dear to the players will be lost. Something that the player will want to protect: themselves, the village or the villagers.

You will find rough concepts for conflicts in the *hooks* section. Don't hesitate to use those directly or just as inspiration.

There must be one or multiple reasons that the problem is not easy to solve. Maybe the cause of the problem is unclear? Maybe solving it requires someone to travel to some place far away. Maybe two characters have incompatible goals.
