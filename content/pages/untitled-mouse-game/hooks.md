# How to use those hooks

In order to use those hooks you must first create player characters and the village (see "preparing the first session").

Those hooks are listed by order of complexity. You will need to spend some time to prepare each of them.

In each hook you can make things as complex or as simple as you want. Try to add enough elements to allow for nice player interactions but don't add more that you can handle yourself. For example try to give a location between 4 and 6 significant NPCs and see how things go. Are you able to juggle your notes? to flesh out each NPC and keep them memorable for the players?

Some sessions will be great. Other less so. Try to learn what works and what don't and you should have a great time.

# The young hedgehog

## Pitch

A young hedgehog is lost around the players' village and is disturbing the tranquility of the villagers (stealing food, making scratches, etc). He must be escorted back to his parents.

## Preparation points

What is the name of the hedgehog? of its parents? Where do they live? How does their house look like? When the player discover the hedgehog, what surprising thing is stuck in its quills?

## Challenges

Introduction:
- the hedgehog might not be identified directly. Describes the traces he leaves around. He will steal food, scratch walls and things will get picked by its quills. Maybe a villager has spotted him and can describe its general shape or a particular detail.

Once the hedgehog is discovered:
- comfort the hedgehog and have him explain where his parents live.
- the hedgehog is young, hungry and fearful. We won't stay in one place, will constantly complain, and will start crying if the players yell at it. Give your players some trouble by forcing them into babysitters.
- cross natural obstacles such as a water stream must be crossed. Require your player to come up with clever solutions like building a bridge. Ask them how they do it and make them roll to find out if they succeed. In case of failure don't block the story (they still succeed to build a bridge but it is weak and may collapse under their weight)
- The hedgehog parents leaves near a farm with a vicious cat. Make him threatening and prideful. Ask the player to come up with a plan to trick him.

## Consequences

Good relationship with the hedgehog family.

# The owl eggs

## Pitch

A neighboring owl threatens the village because it believe the mice have stolen its eggs. The owl is furious and terrifying. A rat clan is the real culprit. They live in a stronghold. They want to eat the eggs. The rat clan terrorize their part of the wood which is one day away from the village.

## Preparation points

How is the rat clan named? What is their symbol? Where is their stronghold located? How does it look like from the outside? From the inside?

## Challenges

- deal with the owl fury and negotiate to buy some time
- identify the real culprits. A red scarf with a symbol is found near the owl nest. An old lady in the village identifies the symbol.
- locate the clan.
- infiltrate the stronghold. With some clever tricks the players may disguise themselves as rats
- Locate the eggs in the stronghold (they are in the food reserve in a special locked room).
- retrieve the eggs and escape.

## Consequences

The owl will become a guardian of the village.

# The mole miners

## Pitch

The ground is shaking because moles are digging a mine underneath the village. The moles are looking for valuable precious stones and are stubborn.

## Preparation points

How many moles are there? What is their name and distinctive trait? How have they found this seam of precious stones?

Look at the tunnel encounter table. Does each entry inspire you? If not try to prepare them a bit or switch the uninspiring entries by something else.

## Challenges

- identify the source of the earthquakes
- explore the tunnels (place various encounters)
- negotiate with the mole. They will need a good reason to leave. Players can try to scare them away or lead them to another mining area.

Tunnel encounters (pick one or roll 1d6):

1. a bunch of disgusting worms
2. Some shiny precious stones in the walls
3. A friendly spider colony
4. A scary snake
5. The moles mining camp
6. An ancient temple. The door is closed. It contains a statue of the creator of the village (this can be developed in another story).

Use this table to spice up the exploration and make the tunnels come to life. None of those encounters should derail the story. But if the story derails try to let the events guide you.

## Consequences

The mayor is grateful that the players were able to stop. The village is partially destroyed.

# The wood workers of the lake village

## Pitch

There is a community of beavers living in a lake far away. They should be able to help with the village reconstruction. However they have their own issues.

The beavers live in a lake and the river has been diverted by the faery king. They have cut some ancient tree worshipped by the elves. The elves are furious and have demanded that the faery king punish the beavers. The faery king is a terrifying looking but peaceful and wise ogre. He was compelled to act. He has thrown a huge rock into the river to divert it. The elves are patrolling near the rock to prevent anyone from removing it.

When the players arrive the level of water is slowly dropping. If it drops too low the beavers will be vulnerable as the entrance to their houses will be revealed.

## Preparation points

How far is the beaver village? Is there a mountain or a sea to cross to reach it?

How big is the beaver village? Who are the notable citizens (name, distinctive trait, etc)? Which one is the best suited to help the player rebuild their village?

Who are the elves leaders? What are their demands towards the beavers? Do they share the same opinion or do they diverge on some points?

What are the riddles that pukka will use to challenge the players?

## Challenge

- reaching the village should be a session in itself
- make sens of the situation: the beaver are scared and don't know why the river was diverted.
- contact the faery king and request an audience in the forest
- negotiate with the king and find a way to sign a peace treaty with the elves
- fulfill the beaver's part of the peace treaty

Forest encounters:

1. tiny walking mushrooms
2. pukka, a treacherous little elf. He will set up traps the players and act as if he was their saviors. Before freeing them he will ask them to solve a riddle
3. a lazy wild cat. He knows about the different faery factions
4. an angry group of elves
5. a taking tree that will try to make the player come close and ensnare them with its roots
6. A friendly elf merchant. He is lost and will give players a minor magic object as a reward such as a glowing moonstone.

## Consequences

The end goal is to convince at least one beaver to come back with the players.
