# why play an rpg

If you are consulting this page that means that you have some level of interest towards role playing games. If you already have a strong opinion about this type of games, you might find the following content obvious or wrong. If you are new to the concept you might find interesting elements about this not quite popular kind of entertainment.

## what is an rpg

An rpg is a structured game of make believe. You probably have played this type of game when you were young. You might have reenacted a TV show you liked with friends. Playing make believe together required some unspoken rules. You had to accept the proposition of others and react to them. Together you were building a common adventure by describing events and maybe acting them out.

Now that you are older you are not doing that anymore. This is an activity for young children. You may partake to their games, but you probably feel bored pretty quickly. You probably don't tell yourself that you should find older make-believe players and say to them "what if we were adventurers exploring a dangerous jungle?". That would be childish and stupid.

You were most probably drawing as a kid. And most probably you are not doing that anymore. However you know that some older people are still drawing and they are doing an amazing job. You are not drawing anymore because you don't have their skills. If you were to draw people would make fun of you because you are terrible.

You probably play boardgames. Some of them are abstract like checkers. Some have a theme such as "the settlers of Catan". Playing those game is safe as long as you follow the rules and that you make an honest attempt at winning. The theme provides a nice flavor to the session. It allows you to immerse in a conflict but with clear rules of engagement. The rules define a game system. You never escape the system.

An rpg is a hybrid activity. It is a conversation between a group of players. Those players are telling a shared story. Each player is responsible for the actions of one of the main characters except the gamemaster who is responsible for everything else. The gamemaster is like a host: he designs a setting and a series of event. He describes the environment to the player and how the world react to their actions.

Rpg's have a set of rules but they don't govern everything. They are usually here to provide guidelines for the gamemaster concerning uncertain situation such as dealing with conflicts. The rules typically include provides a character sheet. This allows players to have a representation of their character that conveys their strength weaknesses and other defining traits. The rules also include a resolution system.

Here is an example:

- gamemaster: a guard is blocking your way.
- player 1: I try to knock him out
- gamemaster: what is your character strength?
- player 1: 3
- gamemaster: roll a dice. On a 4+ it is a success.
- player 1: I got a 2...
- gamemaster: The guards see your punch coming and moves out of the way. He takes a defensive stance and call for help. What do you do?

If all of this sound very vague it is because it is like trying to describe every kind of boardgames to someone you have never seen such a thing. Some rpg use a d20, others use multiple d6. Some rpg focus on the combat, other on the horror. In some games players are trying to "win" (escape a dungeon, kill a werewolf, etc) in others players are focusing on their character believes and aspirations. Moreover the same game can be interpreted very differently but two different gamemasters.

## why playing an rpg works?

The rules provide a common frame for players at the table. It allows them to form an intuition about what is possible and what is not. Rules are something boardgame players are familiar with and can be a good entry point to understand how the game works. It hides the "make believe" behind a layer of complexity.

But the true nature of an rpg is the shared story that happen at the table. You would think that you and your friend don't have anything interesting to say. You would be wrong. Take two to four average persons. Ask them to come up with a character and discuss their motivation. Then give them a clear goal and a bunch of obstacle in their way. Then let the chaos unfold.

While the gamemaster discuss with one of the player, the other have the time to think. The gamemaster may have anticipated a possible course of actions but players will often go in a completely different direction. The ideas coming from one player will feed the inspiration of another one and at the end of the session a story will have unfolded.

The emulation created when everything come together is what motivates every rpg players.

## why it is difficult to play an rpg

Tabletop role are sometime difficult to start. If you don't know any other player you need to pick a game, learn its rules, prepare a story, find interested players and schedule a session. Adding to this, you will need to learn how to actual play the role of a gamemaster: describe efficiently a scene,
call for rolls, interpret outcomes, etc. Blogs such as this one attempt to make thins onboarding less painful.

It can be done. The advantage of taking the hard way is that you will pick a game that appeals to you and players that you appreciate. The easy way is to find an existing group that will teach you the ropes.
