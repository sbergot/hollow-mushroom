# The conversation

This game is a conversation. The GM describes a scene then ask the player "what do you do?". The players describe their actions. If needed the GM calls for a roll. This is all well and good but how things work in practice? What you will say at the beginning of the adventure?

If you have created the started locations with your players (see the
"preparation" chapter) they are already familiar with the setting. This is a good thing because you have to establish the starting conflict in the clearest way and you need to be as concise and clear as possible.

Your players should understand their goal and have a few ideas of their first steps toward it. In your first session it is a good idea to just have a character simply tell them that they need to go in this place and to do that thing. You can be more subtle later if you want.

Things may be a bit a bit awkward at the beginning. Try to give a talking opportunity to each player at the table as soon as possible.

    - GM as NPC1: you need to climb the tree and ask NPC2 about the strange lights!
    - GM: what do you do?
    - Player1: I grab the ladder and start climbing
    - GM: And you player2? Do you follow along or do you want to do something else?

# Describing the world

The player only perceive what the GM tells them or shows them through pictures. The task is challenging. The GM have to:

- provide all relevant information about the scene: the location, characters,
  etc
- add some flavor to make the scene come alive
- be as short as possible to allow players to act

The use of shared context is very important in this situation. Do not describe all details in a tavern if those details match what a common tavern look like. Pick a few details that evoke a specific atmosphere. Try to use a few different senses: sound, smell, temperature. It can be tricky to come up with those details on the fly so try to prepare them in advance.

You will find tables online to generate all kinds of places. They are useful to spark inspiration quickly. This can be as simple as the following:

| Die Roll | Comfort Level (cost/day) | Establishment  |
| -------- | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| 1        | Squalid (1 SP)           | Hostel         |
| 2        | Poor (2 SP)              | Inn            |
| 3        | Modest (5 SP)            | Tavern         |
| 4        | Respectable (1 GP)       | Brothel        |
| 5        | Comfortable (2 GP)       | Boarding House |
| 6        | Wealthy (4 GP)           | Casino         |
| 7        | Lavish (6 GP)            | Hotel          |
| 8        | Royal (10 GP)            | Guest Room     |

Roll one dice for each column and try to picture the result.

# Rolling the dice

Whenever a player takes an action that may fail, pick a target number between 2
and 6 (included) and roll a D6. If the result is higher than the target the action is a success. Knowing how to call a roll, set the target and interpret the result is more art than science. However here is a process that you can follow.

## Understanding the player action

The DM needs to understand the intent and method of the character. The intent is the desired result. The method is the way the character achieves it.

    Sam tries to push the guard in order to reach the door behind. Tristan tries bribe the merchant in order to get him to talk about a specific customer

If a player's action seems illogical or impossible, it is possible that there is a misunderstanding between the GM and the player. Asking questions to clarify both intent and method is the best way to avoid calling a roll that will feel unfair to the player.

## Setting the stakes of a roll

Whenever a roll is called, the following things should be clear in the GM’s mind:

- The target should reflect the difficulty of the task. How likely is the character likely to succeed? Jumping over a 2 meter gap is easier than jumping a 5 meter gap. Things that affect the target:
  - relevant character totem or job
  - advantage or disadvantage in the situation
  - the player has a relevant tool
  - character condition (see bellow)
- The risk is the severity of the consequences in case of a failure. Jumping over a deep gap is riskier than jumping over a shallow one.
- The effect is about the potential gains

The GM should disclose openly the stakes of the rolls. A player should never be surprised by obvious consequences that his character should be able to guess. Describing and discussing the stakes is a great way to convey the tone of a game. The same action will have very different stakes in a superhero setting or in a gritty dangerous story. Don’t forget to play on risks and effects when interpreting an action:

    Sam fights the goblin defensively in order to help his brother escape. The target is 4, low risk, low effect. Tristan fights the goblin aggressively to make him step back. The target is also 4, but with a high risk and high effect.

## Skipping useless rolls

Skipping useless rolls is important to avoid turning a session in a slug. If the difficulty is too low or too high, skip the roll and treat the action as either a success or a failure. If there is no risk the action is also an automatic success because the character can just retry until he succeeds.

    Sam tries to pick a lock in the safety of his home. He succeeds automatically. Tristan tries to pick a lock in the merchant’s mansion. If he fails, a guard is on the corner and Tristan must hide elsewhere.

If the effect is void the GM might skip the roll to avoid losing time.

    Sam tries to escape the prison by digging a hole in the stone wall with a knife. The GM explains that Sam barely makes a scratch and that the noise attracts a guard.

## Interpreting a failed roll

It can be sometimes difficult to interpret a failed roll. As a player they can be disappointing. As a DM they can prevent the story from going where you want to. They require improvisation which can be difficult. Here are some approach you can take to interpret a failure:

- the player pays a price. He get hurt or loses an item. This is sometimes called "failing forward". This is the less disruptive way of taking a failure into account. It can still has interesting consequences by forcing the player to improvise without his tools. Don't hesitate to use this method if the players are too reckless.

  Sam tries to convince the guard to let him pass. The guards accepts but ask for a bribe or requires that Sam abandon his sword.

- the player is put on the spot. He must react quickly to an imminent danger. This raises the tension and delays the consequence a bit. The "real" result of the attempt will depend on whether the players are able to deal with this crisis. See this as a second chance with increased risks. Use this method if one player has a good plan but got an unlucky roll. Don't reuse this option if he fails again after being put on the stop.

  Sam presents false documents to the guard. The guards has some doubts and calls his boss for a double check.

- the player misses his goal. For some reasons he cannot renew the attempt because this option is embedded in the failed rolled. This is the most disruptive answer. It may require some improvisation from the GM but by introducing a constraint it leads to interesting solutions. Most memorable game sessions are those where players are trying to recover from this kind of failures.

  The guard simply refuses to let Sam in. Sam must find another way around.

Those options can be combined. Sam can be refused the entrance **and** the guards calls his colleagues to arrest him.

# Pacing the game

Pacing the story is something that is not easy to do correctly at the beginning. If things are too slow then everyone will feel that nothing is happening and player will be distracted. If things are too quick then it will feel that the story has no weight and no stakes.

A story in a role playing game is very different than a story in a book or a film. However the GM should recognize the pacing tricks used in "passive" media and try to use them. A challenge must seem impossible to overcome at the beginning. The players must discuss a plan. React to surprise obstacles. Find other solutions after a failed dice roll. This will take a lot of time at the table. Once they succeed the story moves forward. The hidden NPC should reveal his secrets. The players reach their destination and are allowed to rest and treat their wound.

The stress level should vary with the pacing. When things get dangerous the in game time slow down and the tension rise. A normal session should have both high and low stress moments. The repartition will depend of the tone you set but even the happiest stories needs a bit of tension and the darkest tales requires moments of rest.

Raise the tension by putting players on the spot. Lower it a bit when they finally pull through the situation.

# Steering the story

The GM describes the world and act as the NPCs. He also calls for the rolls and interpret the results. Being transparent and fair is important so that players forget about the fact that the story is an illusion that the GM struggles to maintain. It is important also to respect the player decisions and the results of the dice rolls. Ignoring either will break the contract that the GM has with the players.

However sometimes the player are having a string of bad luck with their rolls. Or one of the player has an idea likely to derail your story in an unexpected direction. You don't have much time left for your session and you want to finish this story beat. What can you do?

Here are some tricks that will allow you to "guide" the story with some degree of precision. Be careful not to overuse them because it might break the illusion. Also as previously stated being able to go forward with an unexpected failure or player decision is the most rewarding thing for the GM.

## Failing forward

If you are running short on time and want to avoid getting slowed down by a bad roll, use the "failing forward" method (see "Interpreting a failed roll") to still allow the player to achieve his goal.

This is also useful in situations where a "real" failure means certain death for a player (like jumping over a deep gap).

If you overuse it the game can become purely about resource management and less surprising.

## Rolling to success or to failure

The GM controls the granularity of the effect of a given roll. When players are sneaking around in a rat camp, how many rolls should you make? One per mice? In case of success how much should the player be allowed to achieve?

The fairest way to handle such a roll is to only make one. Set the difficulty by taking account factors such as the group size and the guards alertness. In case of success, the players should be allowed to sneak around and do things that can be done without attracting the attention of others. Only call for a role if there is a significant change in the situation or if the player are taking a specific bigger risk.

If you need the player to get caught, you can reduce the scope of a success and call for more rolls. The chance of getting at least one failure or one success is pretty big. Calling for three rolls should be enough to trigger the result you are looking for.

If you need the players to sneak in you can put them of the spot ("the guard hears a noise. He is coming in your direction!") to give them a second chance.
