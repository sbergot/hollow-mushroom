# Why prepare a game

Some people are able to improvise fresh ideas on the spot. They only need a very vague idea to get a session running. In practice, most people struggle to come up with this approach. Improvised ideas might be too generic or too random. When players are going to a new place or meeting a new character, those elements should have something original about them but still fit your world and be well connected to the setting. Doing all that without slowing down the game and breaking the immersion is really hard.

At the same time a preparation which is too rich will also be a problem. It will be harder to consult during the game. You will be tempted to read walls of text to your players. You will hesitate to change things. Writing down details also take time and energy.

A good preparation is a small document that can be easily referenced during the session. It contains characters and locations with a few flavorful details and a links to other characters and locations.

# Using tables to generate things

You will find tables online to generate all kinds of places. They are useful to spark inspiration quickly. This can be as simple as the following:

| Die Roll | Comfort Level (cost/day) | Establishment  |
| -------- | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| 1        | Squalid (1 SP)           | Hostel         |
| 2        | Poor (2 SP)              | Inn            |
| 3        | Modest (5 SP)            | Tavern         |
| 4        | Respectable (1 GP)       | Brothel        |
| 5        | Comfortable (2 GP)       | Boarding House |
| 6        | Wealthy (4 GP)           | Casino         |
| 7        | Lavish (6 GP)            | Hotel          |
| 8        | Royal (10 GP)            | Guest Room     |

Roll one dice for each column and try to picture the result. Ask yourself a few questions:

- Who is the owner?
- Why is this place profitable? Secure?
- Who are the customers?

    You roll a "Poor Casino". You picture an empty derelict place. The owner is also a farmer so it is surrounded by a vegetable garden. The interior is muddy. The owner loves poker and has a gambling addiction. He was never able to make to make a profit because he was loosing his money to his customers.

Now you have a place and a character with a simple idea. Don't add too much details. If the player ask questions make up the details during the session. Of course if the whole adventure happens in this casino then you will need to develop more details. You can roll a second time on the "Establishment" column to add a secondary purpose (it can also be a tavern). The "Comfort level" column can give an indication about the past of the place: was it always crappy or are there traces of its former glory?

Try to link locations and people together. Even in a big city each area can have its own identity and its own network of important characters.
